Instructions to run:

From your IDE you should be able to import a new project from version control (it should ask for a link to this repo)

Once the project is imported you will need to define the JDK. The important part here is that this project uses Java fx...
The way I do it is to use Java 8, which has java fx built-in, download here -> (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)
If you download Java 8, your IDE should allow you to run this project with Java 8. 

This should be all you need to run the project,
once it is running you can type words into the interface (only lowercase letters as of now) 
and suggestions will show up in the box above, you can accept them by pressing alt or option depending on Windows vs mac

If you use Intelij, I can walk you through this setup with more detail if needed.
